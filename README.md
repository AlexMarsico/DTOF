Welcome to the DTOF project!

Our mission is to show that with passion and the desire to pursue a dream, it is possible to create something functional, engaging, and fun using only time and free tools provided by the engine as a budget.
The game was originally created as a university project by three students, but it has since grown into a passionate project that we are all committed to bringing to life.
We are still in the early stages of development, but we are excited to share our progress with the world.
We believe that our game has the potential to be something special and we are always looking for feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to contact us.

Thank you for your interest in our project!
