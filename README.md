Welcome to the DTOF project!

My mission is to prove that with passion and determination, it is possible to create something functional, engaging, and fun using only time and free tools as a budget.
The game was originally created as a university project for an exam, but my goal is to continue working on it and turn it into a real game that can be sold.
I am still in the very early stages of development, but I am excited to share my progress with the world.
I believe that this game has the potential to be something special, and I am always looking for feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your interest in our project!

# Gameplay

## Skills

"The Neuroscience Laboratory" is a skill tree where you can use brain-shaped medals, earned after completing secondary missions, to unlock brain abilities like enhanced vision, telekinesis, and more.

* **Active Skills**
  * Enhanced vision: Enhanced vision: Players will acquire emotions by completing main missions. These emotions can be used to analyze people, providing players with useful information to solve mysteries.
    Specifically, a question system will be used to unlock a reaction. The person's response could provide Dolores with the information she needs to solve the case. If the player makes a mistake in asking questions, the interlocutor could temporarily lose the desire to speak and the player will be forced to focus on other matters.
    The result of the right choices could be represented through visual feedback, such as particles emitted from the interlocutor's body that reflect the emotion felt at that moment. Finally, the notebook will be automatically updated with the information learned.
    Specifically, the 6 primary emotions that can be used are:
     * happiness
     * adness
     * surprise
     * fear
     * anger
     * disgust

  * Elusion: Players can move in a stealthy manner to avoid being detected. This skill can be progressively improved through the purchase of special equipment.
  
  * Telekinesis: The player can use telekinesis to manipulate objects in the game environment. For example, moving objects to create distractions or obstacles for enemies, such as dropping keys to the ground to attract a guard's attention or remotely closing a door to trap an enemy.

* **Passive Skills**
  * Deduction: The character can collect clues and connect them together. This could be represented visually in the game through a notebook-like system, where various pieces of information are laid out. Some pieces of information must be selected in a specific order in order to unlock a deduced piece of information. Correct execution can be represented with visual feedback, such as using the color green for correct execution and red for incorrect execution.

## Reward system
Brain-shaped medals are the medals used to enhance skills. These can only be obtained by completing secondary quests, such as doing well in school, behaving like a good daughter and sister when you're at home, or at least trying to do so.

## Powerup System and Balancing

* Enchanced Vision powerup : Players can earn upgrades that make the enhanced vision ability more effective, such as the ability to analyze it more quickly. To prevent the ability from becoming too easy to use, a "watched" state could be used on the selected player that counters the ability of our player. Analysis speed will have a success percentage based on the difficulty and the player's current level, allowing the analysis before the selected player enters this state.
Time limits on the use of enhanced vision force you to be selective in using the ability.
  
* Elusion powerup : Players can spend in-game points to upgrade their clothing, such as new shoe soles to make less noise. There could be multiple skill levels for evasion, allowing players to gradually improve their stealth abilities.

* Telekinesis powerup : The player will be able to move multiple objects simultaneously and create protective force fields that will allow them to gain time to hide by leaving the enemy's field of vision.

## Inventory

The inventory is a black leather backpack, in which the player can place items collected during gameplay sessions. It offers a category-based organization to facilitate search, and an interaction system with items, allowing the player to examine them or combine them together. Finally, for each item, the inventory also provides an accurate description, providing tips on how to use it or if it is possible to combine it with other items.
