Welcome to the DTOF project!

My mission is to prove that with passion and determination, it is possible to create something functional, engaging, and fun using only time and free tools as a budget.
The game was originally created as a university project for an exam, but my goal is to continue working on it and turn it into a real game that can be sold.
I am still in the very early stages of development, but I am excited to share my progress with the world.
I believe that this game has the potential to be something special, and I am always looking for feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your interest in our project!

# Game’s Overview

## Plot
Dolores Tombeau: The tales Of Feelings is a third-person investigative adventure in which the protagonist, Dolores Tombeau, a young girl with a haunting appearance and a sharp intellect, must travel through time to change the past while trying to shed light on a complex murder case that took place at a prestigious 19th-century academy. Along the way, she will also begin a journey of self-discovery, learning about the human soul in all its facets.

## Story
Dolores is a peculiar girl, but there's nothing wrong with that. She is intelligent, creative, and possesses a macabre sense of humor. She lives with the entire family tree in a large villa called Tomb Estate.

After tormenting the class bully out of sheer boredom, Dolores gets expelled from high school with immediate effect. Touched by her insensitivity but fearing she might end up in a regular school where she wouldn't be accepted for who she is, her parents decide to enroll her in the "Grymstone Academy." A school for misfits, attended by boys and girls who don't fit into the normal world. Dolores is not thrilled with the news since this was the school her parents attended. Being recognized for what she hasn't done and staying in her parents' shadow is not what she desires, but alternatives are limited, so she reluctantly agrees.

On the first day of school, Dolores has to pick up the necessary books from the library. At the library entrance, she encounters the librarian, an old man with a gruff demeanor and an irascible temperament. Tall and thin, with a long white beard and an aquiline nose, he seems more like a guardian of books than a librarian. His skin is wrinkled and dry, like the bark of an ancient tree. His eyes are small and piercing, always seeming irritated by something. His smile is rare and sardonic, and his words are often sharp and sarcastic. A loner who prefers the company of books over people, spending his days among the library shelves, immersed in his world of paper and ink. Dolores hands over the note with the necessary books to the librarian, who without uttering a sound turns and starts searching the shelves. While the librarian is busy with the search, Dolores, in the meantime, starts playing with the librarian's desk. She touches all the objects on it and then begins to stick her nose into the drawers. In one of the drawers, she finds a book with strange features. The book is old and dusty, but Dolores is immediately drawn to it. She takes it and hides it in her small brown leather backpack.

As night falls, Dolores retreats to her lair, much like a bat returning home after a night of scaring the innocent. Lying on her bed, she begins to read the dusty book. It narrates the story of six witches from the past, women who had the power to read others' emotions. They were kind and compassionate, but their power drew the attention of devoted fanatics of a new religious creed that apparently didn't offer discounts even to witches.

Dolores reads carefully, devouring the pages one after another. She is fascinated by their ability to read others' emotions. For her, who can barely feel emotions on her own, this is something unimaginable. Caught up in the reading, Dolores begins to fantasize. Perhaps, she thinks, these witches could help her with her emotional "problem." So, she embarks on the project of creating an object capable of time travel. With this artifact, she can go back in time and save the witches from their sad fate. And so begins Dolores's adventure of self-discovery in a rescue mission through time.

# Gameplay

## Skills

"The Neuroscience Laboratory" is a skill tree where you can use brain-shaped medals, earned after completing secondary missions, to unlock brain abilities like enhanced vision, telekinesis, and more.

* **Active Skills**
  * Enhanced vision: Enhanced vision: Players will acquire emotions by completing main missions. These emotions can be used to analyze people, providing players with useful information to solve mysteries.
    Specifically, a question system will be used to unlock a reaction. The person's response could provide Dolores with the information she needs to solve the case. If the player makes a mistake in asking questions, the interlocutor could temporarily lose the desire to speak and the player will be forced to focus on other matters.
    The result of the right choices could be represented through visual feedback, such as particles emitted from the interlocutor's body that reflect the emotion felt at that moment. Finally, the notebook will be automatically updated with the information learned.
    Specifically, the 6 primary emotions that can be used are:
     * happiness
     * adness
     * surprise
     * fear
     * anger
     * disgust

  * Elusion: Players can move in a stealthy manner to avoid being detected. This skill can be progressively improved through the purchase of special equipment.
  
  * Telekinesis: The player can use telekinesis to manipulate objects in the game environment. For example, moving objects to create distractions or obstacles for enemies, such as dropping keys to the ground to attract a guard's attention or remotely closing a door to trap an enemy.

* **Passive Skills**
  * Deduction: The character can collect clues and connect them together. This could be represented visually in the game through a notebook-like system, where various pieces of information are laid out. Some pieces of information must be selected in a specific order in order to unlock a deduced piece of information. Correct execution can be represented with visual feedback, such as using the color green for correct execution and red for incorrect execution.

## Reward system
Brain-shaped medals are the medals used to enhance skills. These can only be obtained by completing secondary quests, such as doing well in school, behaving like a good daughter and sister when you're at home, or at least trying to do so.

## Powerup system and balancing

* Enchanced Vision powerup : Players can earn upgrades that make the enhanced vision ability more effective, such as the ability to analyze it more quickly. To prevent the ability from becoming too easy to use, a "watched" state could be used on the selected player that counters the ability of our player. Analysis speed will have a success percentage based on the difficulty and the player's current level, allowing the analysis before the selected player enters this state.
Time limits on the use of enhanced vision force you to be selective in using the ability.
  
* Elusion powerup : Players can spend in-game points to upgrade their clothing, such as new shoe soles to make less noise. There could be multiple skill levels for evasion, allowing players to gradually improve their stealth abilities.

* Telekinesis powerup : The player will be able to move multiple objects simultaneously and create protective force fields that will allow them to gain time to hide by leaving the enemy's field of vision.

## Inventory

The inventory is a black leather backpack, in which the player can place items collected during gameplay sessions. It offers a category-based organization to facilitate search, and an interaction system with items, allowing the player to examine them or combine them together. Finally, for each item, the inventory also provides an accurate description, providing tips on how to use it or if it is possible to combine it with other items.
