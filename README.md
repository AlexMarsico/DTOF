Welcome to the DTOF project!

My mission is to prove that with passion and determination, it is possible to create something functional, engaging, and fun using only time and free tools as a budget.
The game was originally created as a university project for an exam, but my goal is to continue working on it and turn it into a real game that can be sold.
I am still in the very early stages of development, but I am excited to share my progress with the world.
I believe that this game has the potential to be something special, and I am always looking for feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your interest in our project!

# Gameplay

## Skills

"The Neuroscience Laboratory" is a skill tree where you can use brain-shaped medals, earned after completing secondary missions, to unlock brain abilities like enhanced vision, telekinesis, and more.

* **Active Skills**
  * Enhanced vision: Players will acquire emotions by completing main missions. These emotions can be used to analyze people, providing players with useful information to       solve mysteries. This could be represented through visual feedback, such as changes in character behavior or appearance that help with the investigation.
    Specifically, the 6 primary emotions that can be used are:
     * happiness
     * adness
     * surprise
     * fear
     * anger
     * disgust

  * Elusion: Players can move in a stealthy manner to avoid being detected. This skill can be progressively improved through the purchase of special equipment.
  
  * Telekinesis: The player can use telekinesis to manipulate objects in the game environment. For example, moving objects to create distractions or obstacles for enemies,      such as dropping keys to the ground to attract a guard's attention or remotely closing a door to trap an enemy.

* **Passive Skills**
  * Deduction: The character can collect clues and connect them together. This could be represented visually in the game through a notebook-like system, where various           pieces of information are laid out. Some pieces of information must be selected in a specific order in order to unlock a deduced piece of information. Correct execution     can be represented with visual feedback, such as using the color green for correct execution and red for incorrect execution.

## Reward system
Brain-shaped medals are the medals used to enhance skills. These can only be obtained by completing secondary quests, such as doing well in school, behaving like a good daughter and sister when you're at home, or at least trying to do so.

## Powerup System and Balancing

* Enchanced Vision powerup : Players can earn upgrades that make the enhanced vision ability more effective, such as the ability to analyze it more quickly. To prevent the ability from becoming too easy to use, a "watched" state could be used on the selected player that counters the ability of our player. Analysis speed will have a success percentage based on the difficulty and the player's current level, allowing the analysis before the selected player enters this state.
  
* Elusion powerup : Players can spend in-game points to upgrade their clothing, such as new shoe soles to make less noise. There could be multiple skill levels for evasion, allowing players to gradually improve their stealth abilities.
